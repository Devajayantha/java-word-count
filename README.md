# CSG Java Coding Assignment


## Introduction
A program counts words based on certain rules. There are two main rules: one is to count words by their characters, and the other is to show all words if they are longer than a certain length. I tried to merge these rules into one program. Although I'm tryng use OOP concepts, the implementation might not be perfect yet.

From what I've understood, this program take input a sentence. Then, But in background it working two things with same input: counts the words based on how many characters they have, and lists all the words that are longer than a specific length. Both tasks use the same input but handle it differently, so that makes has different output.
